# my-printf


This project is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, designed to mimic its functionality while supporting common format specifiers such as %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, %p, and %%. It uses variadic functions, specifically the va_list type, to handle a variable number of arguments. The va_list type, along with the va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros from the stdarg.h library, allows the function to dynamically retrieve the arguments passed to printf. Through this project, I learned how to manage variadic arguments, parse format strings, handle various data types and conversions, and implement custom memory management. I also gained a deeper understanding of how va_list works in C to access and process a flexible number of arguments, along with type casting, buffer handling, and managing edge cases like null pointers and invalid format specifiers.
